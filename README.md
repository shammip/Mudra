# Mudra

An app that can classify a Bharatnatyam mudra (classical dance hand pose) from an image. 

**Plan to build the app:** 
* Collect and categorize data images into training and testing data sets.
* Train a **Core ML** model that can classify hand poses using **Create ML** and its Image Classification template.
* Integrate model into an app that can classify hand pose from an image using **Swift** in **Xcode**.
